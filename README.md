Mars Bot is an open-source discord bot developed by [Mebrooks01#3354](https://github.com/BruhFish)
You can add it to your server with [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=760605516384305224&scope=bot&permissions=3288726593). If you have any questions you can join [our discord server](https://discord.gg/yKnBYJE).

Mars Bot uses NASA's API and other sources to give you plenty of cool information about missions and even look at the weather on Mars (when NASA/JPL-Caltech decides to give the data to the API).

I will only be walking through the process for Windows 10. You will need **node.js** and **git** to run this bot on your own. You can get node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and git [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
